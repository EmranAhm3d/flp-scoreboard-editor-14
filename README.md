# Introduction
After millions of request and months of research, it's finally coming through. For the first time ever, FIFA 14 is about to it's have dedicated scoreboard editor tool. It will work identically how FHL Scoreboard worked for FIFA 11/12.
The tool is entirely written in python and it's Tkinter toolkit. To install, just run the installer and install it to anywhere you desire. If your anti-virus flags it as a malware, don't worry. It's obviously a false positive. Add it to your anti-virus exception list and you are good to go.
Enjoy making new scoreboards!
